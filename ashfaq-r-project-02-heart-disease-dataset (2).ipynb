    "> Heart disease is a catch-all phrase for a variety of conditions that affect the heart’s structure and function. Coronary heart disease is a type of heart disease that develops when the arteries of the heart cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart. __It is the leading cause of death in the United States__.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Emphasis by me. Source: https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/espanol/enfermedad-coronaria)\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook we try to learn enough information of this topic to understand the [Heart Disease UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) dataset and build simple models to predict whether a patient has a disease or not based on features like the heart rate during exercise or the cholesterol levels in the blood.\n",

    "\n",
    "Blood is transported to the rest of the body because it is pumped by the heart. This organ receives oxygen-poor blood and sends it to the lungs to oxygenate it. And sends the oxygen-rich blood that comes from the lugns to the rest of the body.\n",

    "In the worst case, the impact of leaving the cells of the heart without nutrients and oxygen is a heart attack, in other words, the death of part of the heart cells. This, in turn, would have an impact on the rest of the body because the pumping of the heart would be affected.\n",

    "- **Atherosclerosis:** accumulation of substances on the walls of arteries which can hinder the blood flow. Moreover, the rupture of this plaque of substances can cause the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) that, in turn, can block even more the affected area or go to other parts of the body and block those parts (embolism). (Sources: [American Heart Association](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cholesterol/about-cholesterol/atherosclerosis), [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569))\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ischemia:** blood flow reduction to a tissue. This implies a reduction of the supply of oxygen and nutrients, so cells won't get enough energy to function properly. (Sources: [American Heart Association](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/about-heart-attacks/silent-ischemia-and-ischemic-heart-disease), [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myocardial-ischemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20375417), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia))\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Angina:** chest pain due to a blood flow reduction in the coronary arteries. (Sources: [United Kingdom National Health Service](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/angina/), [(Spanish) Video sobre angina de Alberto Sanagustín](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UhItS50mRI))\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stable angina:** angina caused by situations that requires oxygen (for example, exercise or stress) and it goes away on rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unstable angina:** angina that can happen even on rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Typican & atypical angina:** typical angina usually means a chest disconfort. However, looks like some people can experience other symptoms like nausea or shortness of breath. In these cases people talk about atypical angina. (Sources: [Harrington Hospital](https://www.harringtonhospital.org/typical-and-atypical-angina-what-to-look-for/), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angina#Diagnosis)).\n",

    "- **Thrombus:** blood mass in solid state that hinders the blood flow in a blood vessel. (Source: [MedlinePlus](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001124.htm))\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Embolus:** thrombus that detatches and goes to other parts of the body. (Source: [MedlinePlus](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001124.htm))\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Acute myocardial infarction:** also known as _heart attack_, is the death of part of the heart tissue due to an ischemia. In other words, it is the death of part of the cells due to the lack of oxygen. (Sources: [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/acute-myocardial-infarction#causes), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction))\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Electrocardiogram:** graph record of the electric signals that causes heart beats. Each part of the record of a normal heart beat has a name, the most interesting ones for this project are the T wave and the ST segment because they can give some information about the presence of issues like an ischemia or infarction. (Sources: [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983), [Wikipedia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiograma), [(Spanish) Video sobre electrocardiograma de Alberto Sanagustín](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A67NDj3_RrU), [(Spanish) Serie de videos sobre el electrocardiograma normal de Alberto Sangaustín](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLe281LBBRU&list=PL3BE5DA0A5DF3BF75))\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nuclear stress test:** a radioactive dye is injected into the patient to see the blood flow on rest and doing exercise. Moreover, during this test the activity of the heart is also measured with an electrocardiogram. (Sources: [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/nuclear-stress-test/about/pac-20385231), [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/thallium-stress-test))\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Asymptomatic disease:** a disease that a patient has but they experience very few or no symptoms.

    "\n",
    "- **Left ventricular hypertrophy:** thickening of the walls of the main heart chamber that pumps the blood to the rest of the body. This can cause the muscle to loose elasticity which, in turns, causes the heart to not work properly.

    "The above figures provide two different graphical representations of the association between the heart rate and the presence of disease. There is a negative correlation between age and heart rate which means the older a person is, the lower their heart rate gets. According to the above data, people with the disease (shown in orange) have lower heart rates than the ones with no disease (shown in blue). It looks like there are more younger people in this dataset with target = 1, than target = 0. \n"
